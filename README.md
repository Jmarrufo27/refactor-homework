# refactor-homework

** The purpose of this homework is to refactor a webpage and make sure all interactive elements are working properly 
and doing everything to consolidate and simplify CSS selectors and changes as well as make sure it uses semantic HTML 
in order for code to be sustainable long term and easily debugged. Along the way I will be adding comments to the files 
based on the changes I make **
